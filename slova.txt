your
surprise
could
not
be
greater
than
mine
in
being
noticed
by
you
my
conscience
told
me
that
i
deserved
no
extraordinary
politeness
and
i
confess
that
i
did
not
expect
to
receive
more
than
my
due
my
object
then
replied
darcy
was
to
show
you
by
every
civility
in
my
power
that
i
was
not
so
mean
as
to
resent
the
past
and
i
hoped
to
obtain
your
forgiveness
to
lessen
your
ill
opinion
by
letting
you
see
that
your
reproofs
had
been
attended
to
how
soon
any
other
wishes
introduced
themselves
i
can
hardly
tell
but
i
believe
in
about
half
an
hour
after
i
had
seen
you
he
then
told
her
of
georgianas
delight
in
her
acquaintance
and
of
her
disappointment
at
its
sudden
interruption
which
naturally
leading
to
the
cause
of
that
interruption
she
soon
learnt
that
his
resolution
of
following
her
from
derbyshire
in
quest
of
her
sister
had
been
formed
before
he
quitted
the
inn
and
that
his
gravity
and
thoughtfulness
there
had
arisen
from
no
other
struggles
than
what
such
a
purpose
must
comprehend
she
expressed
her
gratitude
again
but
it
was
too
painful
a
subject
to
each
to
be
dwelt
on
farther
after
walking
several
miles
in
a
leisurely
manner
and
too
busy
to
know
anything
about
it
they
found
at
last
on
examining
their
watches
that
it
was
time
to
be
at
home
what
could
become
of
mr
bingley
and
jane
was
a
wonder
which
introduced
the
discussion
of
their
affairs
darcy
was
delighted
with
their
engagement
his
friend
had
given
him
the
earliest
information
of
it
i
must
ask
whether
you
were
surprised
said
elizabeth
not
at
all
when
i
went
away
i
felt
that
it
would
soon
happen
that
is
to
say
you
had
given
your
permission
i
guessed
as
much
and
though
he
exclaimed
at
the
term
she
found
that
it
had
been
pretty
much
the
case
on
the
evening
before
my
going
to
london
said
he
i
made
a
confession
to
him
which
i
believe
i
ought
to
have
made
long
ago
i
told
him
of
all
that
had
occurred
to
make
my
former
interference
in
his
affairs
absurd
and
impertinent
his
surprise
was
great
he
had
never
had
the
slightest
suspicion
i
told
him
moreover
that
i
believed
myself
mistaken
in
supposing
as
i
had
done
that
your
sister
was
indifferent
to
him
and
as
i
could
easily
perceive
that
his
attachment
to
her
was
unabated
i
felt
no
doubt
of
their
happiness
together
elizabeth
could
not
help
smiling
at
his
easy
manner
of
directing
his
friend
did
you
speak
from
your
own
observation
said
she
when
you
told
him
that
my
sister
loved
him
or
merely
from
my
information
last
spring
from
the
former
i
had
narrowly
observed
her
during
the
two
visits
which
i
had
lately
made
here
and
i
was
convinced
of
her
affection
and
your
assurance
of
it
i
suppose
carried
immediate
conviction
to
him
it
did
bingley
is
most
unaffectedly
modest
his
diffidence
had
prevented
his
depending
on
his
own
judgment
in
so
anxious
a
case
but
his
reliance
on
mine
made
every
thing
easy
i
was
obliged
to
confess
one
thing
which
for
a
time
and
not
unjustly
offended
him
i
could
not
allow
myself
to
conceal
that
your
sister
had
been
in
town
three
months
last
winter
that
i
had
known
it
and
purposely
kept
it
from
him
he
was
angry
but
his
anger
i
am
persuaded
lasted
no
longer
than
he
remained
in
any
doubt
of
your
sisters
sentiments
he
has
heartily
forgiven
me
now
elizabeth
longed
to
observe
that
mr
bingley
had
been
a
most
delightful
friend
so
easily
guided
that
his
worth
was
invaluable
but
she
checked
herself
she
remembered
that
he
had
yet
to
learn
to
be
laughed
at
and
it
was
rather
too
early
to
begin
in
anticipating
the
happiness
of
bingley
which
of
course
was
to
be
inferior
only
to
his
own
he
continued
the
conversation
till
they
reached
the
house
in
the
hall
they
parted
chapter
my
dear
lizzy
where
can
you
have
been
walking
to
was
a
question
which
elizabeth
received
from
jane
as
soon
as
she
entered
their
room
and
from
all
the
others
when
they
sat
down
to
table
she
had
only
to
say
in
reply
that
they
had
wandered
about
till
she
was
beyond
her
own
knowledge
she
coloured
as
she
spoke
but
neither
that
nor
anything
else
awakened
a
suspicion
of
the
truth
the
evening
passed
quietly
unmarked
by
anything
extraordinary
the
acknowledged
lovers
talked
and
laughed
the
unacknowledged
were
silent
darcy
was
not
of
a
disposition
in
which
happiness
overflows
in
mirth
and
elizabeth
agitated
and
confused
rather
knew
that
she
was
happy
than
felt
herself
to
be
so
for
besides
the
immediate
embarrassment
there
were
other
evils
before
her
she
anticipated
what
would
be
felt
in
the
family
when
her
situation
became
known
she
was
aware
that
no
one
liked
him
but
jane
and
even
feared
that
with
the
others
it
was
a
dislike
which
not
all
his
fortune
and
consequence
might
do
away
at
night
she
opened
her
heart
to
jane
though
suspicion
was
very
far
from
miss
bennets
general
habits
she
was
absolutely
incredulous
here
you
are
joking
lizzy
this
cannot
be
engaged
to
mr
darcy
no
no
you
shall
not
deceive
me
i
know
it
to
be
impossible
this
is
a
wretched
beginning
indeed
my
sole
dependence
was
on
you
and
i
am
sure
nobody
else
will
believe
me
if
you
do
not
yet
indeed
i
am
in
earnest
i
speak
nothing
but
the
truth
he
still
loves
me
and
we
are
engaged
jane
looked
at
her
doubtingly
oh
lizzy
it
cannot
be
i
know
how
much
you
dislike
him
you
know
nothing
of
the
matter
that
is
all
to
be
forgot
perhaps
i
did
not
always
love
him
so
well
as
i
do
now
but
in
such
cases
as
these
a
good
memory
is
unpardonable
this
is
the
last
time
i
shall
ever
remember
it
myself
miss
bennet
still
looked
all
amazement
elizabeth
again
and
more
seriously
assured
her
of
its
truth
good
heaven
can
it
be
really
so
yet
now
i
must
believe
you
cried
jane
my
dear
dear
lizzy
i
would
i
do
congratulate
you
but
are
you
certain
forgive
the
question
are
you
quite
certain
that
you
can
be
happy
with
him
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
that
it
is
settled
between
us
already
that
we
are
to
be
the
happiest
couple
in
the
world
but
are
you
pleased
jane
shall
you
like
to
have
such
a
brother
very
very
much
nothing
could
give
either
bingley
or
myself
more
delight
but
we
considered
it
we
talked
of
it
as
impossible
and
do
you
really
love
him
quite
well
enough
oh
lizzy
do
anything
rather
than
marry
without
affection
are
you
quite
sure
that
you
feel
what
you
ought
to
do
oh
yes
you
will
only
think
i
feel
more
than
i
ought
to
do
when
i
tell
you
all
what
do
you
mean
why
i
must
confess
that
i
love
him
better
than
i
do
bingley
i
am
afraid
you
will
be
angry
my
dearest
sister
now
be
serious
i
want
to
talk
very
seriously
let
me
know
every
thing
that
i
am
to
know
without
delay
will
you
tell
me
how
long
you
have
loved
him
it
has
been
coming
on
so
gradually
that
i
hardly
know
when
it
began
but
i
believe
i
must
date
it
from
my
first
seeing
his
beautiful
grounds
at
pemberley
another
entreaty
that
she
would
be
serious
however
produced
the
desired
effect
and
she
soon
satisfied
jane
by
her
solemn
assurances
of
attachment
when
convinced
on
that
article
miss
bennet
had
nothing
further
to
wish
now
i
am
quite
happy
said
she
for
you
will
be
as
happy
as
myself
i
always
had
a
value
for
him
were
it
for
nothing
but
his
love
of
you
i
must
always
have
esteemed
him
but
now
as
bingleys
friend
and
your
husband
there
can
be
only
bingley
and
yourself
more
dear
to
me
but
lizzy
you
have
been
very
sly
very
reserved
with
me
how
little
did
you
tell
me
of
what
passed
at
pemberley
and
lambton
i
owe
all
that
i
know
of
it
to
another
not
to
you
elizabeth
told
her
the
motives
of
her
secrecy
she
had
been
unwilling
to
mention
bingley
and
the
unsettled
state
of
her
own
feelings
had
made
her
equally
avoid
the
name
of
his
friend
but
now
she
would
no
longer
conceal
from
her
his
share
in
lydias
marriage
all
was
acknowledged
and
half
the
night
spent
in
conversation
good
gracious
cried
mrs
bennet
as
she
stood
at
a
window
the
next
morning
if
that
disagreeable
mr
darcy
is
not
coming
here
again
with
our
dear
bingley
what
can
he
mean
by
being
so
tiresome
as
to
be
always
coming
here
i
had
no
notion
but
he
would
go
a
shooting
or
something
or
other
and
not
disturb
us
with
his
company
what
shall
we
do
with
him
lizzy
you
must
walk
out
with
him
again
that
he
may
not
be
in
bingleys
way
elizabeth
could
hardly
help
laughing
at
so
convenient
a
proposal
yet
was
really
vexed
that
her
mother
should
be
always
giving
him
such
an
epithet
as
soon
as
they
entered
bingley
looked
at
her
so
expressively
and
shook
hands
with
such
warmth
as
left
no
doubt
of
his
good
information
and
he
soon
afterwards
said
aloud
mrs
bennet
have
you
no
more
lanes
hereabouts
in
which
lizzy
may
lose
her
way
again
to
day
i
advise
mr
darcy
and
lizzy
and
kitty
said
mrs
bennet
to
walk
to
oakham
mount
this
morning
it
is
a
nice
long
walk
and
mr
darcy
has
never
seen
the
view
it
may
do
very
well
for
the
others
replied
mr
bingley
but
i
am
sure
it
will
be
too
much
for
kitty
wont
it
kitty
kitty
owned
that
she
had
rather
stay
at
home
darcy
professed
a
great
curiosity
to
see
the
view
from
the
mount
and
elizabeth
silently
consented
as
she
went
up
stairs
to
get
ready
mrs
bennet
followed
her
saying
i
am
quite
sorry
lizzy
that
you
should
be
forced
to
have
that
disagreeable
man
all
to
yourself
but
i
hope
you
will
not
mind
it
it
is
all
for
janes
sake
you
know
and
there
is
no
occasion
for
talking
to
him
except
just
now
and
then
so
do
not
put
yourself
to
inconvenience
during
their
walk
it
was
resolved
that
mr
bennets
consent
should
be
asked
in
the
course
of
the
evening
elizabeth
reserved
to
herself
the
application
for
her
mothers
she
could
not
determine
how
her
mother
would
take
it
sometimes
doubting
whether
all
his
wealth
and
grandeur
would
be
enough
to
overcome
her
abhorrence
of
the
man
but
whether
she
were
violently
set
against
the
match
or
violently
delighted
with
it
it
was
certain
that
her
manner
would
be
equally
ill
adapted
to
do
credit
to
her
sense
and
she
could
no
more
bear
that
mr
darcy
should
hear
the
first
raptures
of
her
joy
than
the
first
vehemence
of
her
disapprobation
